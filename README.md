# World Happiness Prediction using Regression Analysis
In this report, I have attempted to predict happiness using based on independent variables from The World Bank. Throughout this report, I have explained each step and evaluated my findings.

In this repository the World_Happiness_Prediction_using_Regression_Analysis.ipynb Notebook file is the complete report with working scripts. There is also a World_Happiness_Prediction_using_Regression_Analysis.html file that contains the entire report including scripts and output for simple, non-functional viewing.
